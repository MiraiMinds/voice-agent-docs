## Voice Agent Features

Voice agents are AI-powered conversational systems that automate voice interactions at scale. They understand natural language, manage call flows, and connect to your systems to resolve common requests, book appointments, or route complex issues to humans — lowering cost, increasing availability, and improving customer experience.
