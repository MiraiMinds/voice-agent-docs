### Step 3: Data Management Setup

#### Option A: CSV Data Upload

6. **Download CSV Template**

   Click **"Download CSV Template"** to get the correct format for your contact data.

   ![Download CSV template](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_6.png)

7. **Prepare Your Contact Data**

   Update the downloaded CSV template with your contact information, ensuring all required fields are completed.

8. **Upload CSV File**

   Upload your completed CSV file using the file upload interface.

   ![CSV upload interface](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_7.png)

9. **Preview Contact Data**

   Review your uploaded data in the right panel preview to verify accuracy before proceeding.

   ![Data preview panel](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_8.png)

#### Option B: API Integration

When webhook is enabled, your platform can send contact data directly through API calls, eliminating the need for manual CSV uploads.

### Step 4: Schedule Configuration

10. **Set Campaign Dates**

    Configure your campaign timeline:

    - **Start Date**: Select when the campaign should begin
    - **End Date**: Choose when the campaign should conclude

    ![Date selection interface](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_9.png)

11. **Configure Timezone**

    Select the appropriate timezone for your campaign to ensure calls are made at the right local times.

    ![Timezone configuration](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_10.png)

12. **Set Operating Hours**

    Define your campaign's daily calling window:

    - **Start Time**: When calls can begin each day
    - **End Time**: When calls should stop each day

    ![Operating hours configuration](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_11.png)

### Step 5: Call Behavior Settings

13. **Configure Retry Logic**

    Set how the system handles unsuccessful call attempts:

    - **Retry Count**: Number of attempts to reach each contact
    - **Re-Attempt Period**: Time interval between retry attempts

    ![Retry configuration](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_12.png)
    ![Re-Attempt Configuration](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_13.png)

14. **Set Call Duration Limits**

    Configure call timing parameters:

    - **Maximum Call Duration**: Longest allowable call time
    - **Inactivity Period**: Wait time during no response before ending calls

    ![Maximum call duration settings](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_14.png)
    ![Inactivity period settings](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_15.png)

### Step 6: Launch Campaign

15. **Create**

    Once all settings are configured, click **"Create Campaign"** to Create your campaign.

    ![Create campaign final step](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_16.png)

16. **Handle Data Validation**

    After clicking create, the system processes your data:

    - **Valid Data**: Successfully stored and included in the campaign
    - **Invalid/Missing Data**: Not stored but displayed in a validation modal

    Any invalid or missing entries will be shown in list format, allowing you to download this data for correction and potential re-upload.

### Step 7: Launch and Manage Campaign

17. **Launch Your Campaign**

    After creating your campaign, navigate to the campaign list to launch it. Click the **"Play"** button next to your campaign to start making calls.

    ![Campaign list with play button](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_17.png)

18. **Track Campaign Status**

    Monitor your campaign's progress by visiting the **Campaign Status** page. Here you can view:

    - Call completion rates
    - Success/failure statistics
    - Real-time campaign progress
    - Contact attempt history

    ![Campaign status tracking page](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_18.png)

19. **Copy Webhook API Endpoint**

    If you enabled webhook integration, you can copy the API endpoint for your platform integration. Click **"Copy Webhook"** to get the endpoint URL for sending data via API.

    ![Copy webhook endpoint button](../../../assets/campaign-integration/image_19.png)

    Use this endpoint to programmatically add contacts to your campaign or trigger campaign events from your existing systems.

## What's Next?

Once your campaign is created and launched, you can:

- **Monitor Performance** - Track call success rates and campaign progress
- **Manage Active Campaigns** - Pause, resume, or modify running campaigns
- **Analyze Results** - Review detailed campaign analytics and outcomes
- **Export Reports** - Download campaign performance data

## Best Practices

### Data Preparation

- Test your CSV data with a small sample before uploading large datasets
- Ensure phone numbers are properly formatted for your target regions
- Include all required fields to minimize data validation issues

### Campaign Optimization

- Set reasonable retry limits to avoid overwhelming contacts
- Configure appropriate operating hours to respect contact preferences
- Monitor initial performance and adjust settings as needed

### Compliance Considerations

- Ensure you have proper consent to contact all numbers in your campaign
- Respect do-not-call lists and opt-out requests
- Follow local regulations for automated calling
