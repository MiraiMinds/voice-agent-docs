3. **Access Voice Agents Dashboard**

   Navigate to the **Campaigns** section in your Voice Agents platform and create a new campaign.

6. **Setup Webhook in Klaviyo**

   Return to your Klaviyo flow and configure the webhook node with the details from your Voice Agent campaign:

   - Paste the **Webhook URL** in the endpoint field

7. **Test and Activate**

   Test your webhook connection to ensure data flows correctly between Klaviyo and Voice Agents, then activate your flow.

## What's Next?

Once your integration is complete, your Klaviyo flows can automatically trigger voice agent calls for:

- **Abandoned Cart Recovery** - Reach customers who left items in their cart
- **Post-Purchase Follow-up** - Collect feedback and encourage repeat purchases
- **Replenishment Reminders** - Notify customers when it's time to reorder
- **Win-back Campaigns** - Re-engage inactive customers with personalized calls

The voice agent will receive customer data from Klaviyo and can personalize conversations based on purchase history, preferences, and behavior patterns.
