Welcome to the Voice Agents Developer Hub. Our API allows you to programmatically trigger voice calls, manage agents, and integrate voice capabilities directly into your applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.voice-agents.miraiminds.co/v1
```

## Authentication

We use a workspace and organization-based authentication system. Every request to the API must include the following headers to identify your account:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `workspace` | Your unique workspace identifier (e.g., `68d63c242cd956c2bb41cd3a`) |
| `organization` | Your organization identifier (e.g., `68d63c242cd956c2bb41cd12`) |
| `Authorization` | Your Bearer token (e.g., `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...`) |

<aside>
  To get your Organization ID, Workspace ID, and Authorization Token, please contact [sneh@miraiminds.co](mailto:sneh@miraiminds.co).

## Quick Start

2.  **Choose an Assistant**
    Identify the `assistant_id` of the voice agent you want to trigger.
